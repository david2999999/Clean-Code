## The Grand Redesign in the Sky
If you have been a programmer for more than two or three years, you have probably been
significantly slowed down by someone else’s messy code. If you have been a programmer
for longer than two or three years, you have probably been slowed down by messy code.
The degree of the slowdown can be significant. Over the span of a year or two, teams that
were moving very fast at the beginning of a project can find themselves moving at a snail’s
pace. Every change they make to the code breaks two or three other parts of the code. No
change is trivial. Every addition or modification to the system requires that the tangles,
twists, and knots be “understood” so that more tangles, twists, and knots can be added.
Over time the mess becomes so big and so deep and so tall, they can not clean it up. There
is no way at all.

As the mess builds, the productivity of the team continues to decrease, asymptotically
approaching zero. As productivity decreases, management does the only thing they can;
they add more staff to the project in hopes of increasing productivity. But that new staff is
not versed in the design of the system. They don’t know the difference between a change
that matches the design intent and a change that thwarts the design intent. Furthermore,
they, and everyone else on the team, are under horrific pressure to increase productivity. So
they all make more and more messes, driving the productivity ever further toward zero.

Eventually the team rebels. They inform management that they cannot continue to develop
in this odious code base. They demand a redesign. Management does not want to expend
the resources on a whole new redesign of the project, but they cannot deny that productivity
is terrible. Eventually they bend to the demands of the developers and authorize the
grand redesign in the sky.

A new tiger team is selected. Everyone wants to be on this team because it’s a greenfield
project. They get to start over and create something truly beautiful. But only the best
and brightest are chosen for the tiger team. Everyone else must continue to maintain the
current system.

Now the two teams are in a race. The tiger team must build a new system that does
everything that the old system does. Not only that, they have to keep up with the changes
that are continuously being made to the old system. Management will not replace the old
system until the new system can do everything that the old system does.

This race can go on for a very long time. I’ve seen it take 10 years. And by the time it’s
done, the original members of the tiger team are long gone, and the current members are
demanding that the new system be redesigned because it’s such a mess.

If you have experienced even one small part of the story I just told, then you already
know that spending time keeping your code clean is not just cost effective; it’s a matter of
professional survival.
